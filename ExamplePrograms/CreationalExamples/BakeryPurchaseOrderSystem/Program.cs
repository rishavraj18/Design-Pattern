    /// Here we have a PO Builder that we use to generate purchase orders for our bakery.
    /// Creating a new instance of a Purchase Order can be a confusing and lengthy process.
    /// To improve the experience of instantiating new Purchase Order objects, and to make
    /// the semantics more clear, we make use of the Builder Pattern.
    /// One of the design benefits of the Builder Pattern is that the algorithms for constructing
    /// an object are independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
    /// We can demonstrate two types of builder pattern approaches:
    /// - Builder + Director collaboration,
    ///     where depending on the concrete type of Builder provided to the Director, a different PO will be generated.
    ///     We can encapsulate the building of a PO for particular vendors in their own Builder Types.
    /// - Fluent Builder pattern,
    ///     We allow the creation of custom Purchase orders using a fluent syntax to set custom properties on 
    ///     instances of the same PurchaseOrder type. In C#, we can also make it very easy to cast our Builder
    ///     (where the construction logic is defined) into the Type of object it builds using an implicit operator.
